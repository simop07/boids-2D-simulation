## Introduction

[Boids](#boids) is the project developed by four Physics freshmen during 2021-2022 course [Programmazione per la fisica](https://github.com/giacomini/pf2021/), for their final exam.

## Simulation of the behavior of flighting birds in two-dimensional space

[Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) is an artificial life program firstly developed by **Craig W. Reynolds** in 1986. The program simulates the flocking behaviour of birds.\
This project is written in [C++](https://isocpp.org/) programming language.
